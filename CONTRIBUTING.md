Bug fixes and new project types/languages are welcome, however please don't submit any 'joke' PRs or Issues.

If you find any bugs, then open an issue and if possible, please fix it and say in the issue that you are going to be working on it, and submit a PR once you fix it linking to the issue, however if you cannot fix it, then specify that you won't be able to fix it and I will look at it, or someone else can come in to fix it, if you want to fix a bug, please comment on it sayig that you will do so and in the PR link to the issue.

I am also open to PRs for new features or optimisations of the code but *please* stay in the same style of coding as the surrounding code.
