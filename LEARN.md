# Why Did I Build This?

This project was made as a part of Hack Club's Summer of Making, and was a project I created to... well simplify the project creation process

I build this as a project to help me out and to learn how to make TUIs.
The best way that, I feel, you can lean is to create a project around it and this is what drove me to create this.

# How Did I Build This?

Well now onto the **how** of building this.

Simply, rust + ratatui and *lots* of searching up solutions to problems

More complicatedly:

I started off with the good old `cargo init` then search up good TUI library for rust and I discovered ratatui and added it

Then I started creating the UI for it through the process of, search up how to do what part of the UI I want, impliment, try it out, fix issues, repeat

After that, I had to impliment the actual project creation logic. This was simple for some things like rust, and uv, but for the other two... that was annoying becuse I had to figure out what commands I wanted

Then I had a working TUI

# Conclusion

This was a very fun project to make, though if I were to do it again, then I would probably use a different library or even just not use rust at all.

I hope you had fun reading this Happy Hacking!

Signing off,
